## Learnings and project structure

### Tekton Basics
Tekton is a powerful yet flexible Kubernetes-native open source framework for creating continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) systems. The goal is to make CI/CD easier for everyone. It does this by giving you maximum flexibility, meaning, it abstracts the underlying implementation details and specific concepts of Kubernetes. The users can focus on creating powerful pipelines and choose the build, test and deploy workflows based on their team's requirements. All the building blocks are basically Kubernetes CRDs (Custom Resource Definition).
